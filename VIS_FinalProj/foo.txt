1.US: 
Bush became the first Republican president since the 1950s to enjoy a majority in both houses of Congress. Among !!!!
the initial domestic challenges that faced the Bush administration were a weakening national economy and an energy !!!!
crisis in California. Bush, who had campaigned as a �compassionate conservative,� promoted traditionally conservative !!!!
policies in domestic affairs, the centrepiece of which was a $1.35 trillion tax-cut bill he signed into law in June 2001. !!!!
That month, however, Republican Sen. Jim Jeffords became an independent, giving the Democrats control of the Senate.!!!!
 Subsequently Bush encountered strong congressional resistance to some of his initiatives, such as an educational !!!!
 voucher program that would provide subsidies to parents who send their children to private schools, the creation !!!!
 of a nuclear missile defense system, and federal funding for selected social programs of religious groups. !!!!
 In foreign affairs, the administration attempted to liberalize U.S. immigration policy with regard to Mexico, !!!!
 with which it struck closer ties. But it faced sharp criticism from China for its outspoken support of Taiwan and !!!!
 from Europe and elsewhere for its abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty aimed at reducing the emission!!!!
  of greenhouse gases, and for its declared intention to withdraw from the 1972 Treaty on the Limitation !!!!
  of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (it formally withdrew from the treaty in 2002).
******China: 
China's economy has maintained an annual growth rate of 9.8 per cent on average in the past two decades and  is !!!!
likely to sustain a rapid development with less fluctuation in growth rate
Remarks by Deng Xiaoping on his 1992 tour !!!!
to southern China and the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China had clearly defined the establishment !!!!
of a socialist market economy as the objective of China's economic reform
Changes have taken place in China's ownership !!!!
structure since 1990s.!!!!
The market mechanism has been notably bolstered to play a fundamental role in the allocation of resources Market !!!!
economy, in essence, is an open economy, so China's economic reform and development is inseparable from the !!!!
development of the world economy
Regionalized economies and economic groups has developed rapidly throughout the !!!!
world since the mid 1980s. What will be the prospects for China's market economy in the 21st century as Hong Kong !!!!
has been returned to China and cross-Straits economic exchanges develop?
The last few years of the 1990s is the most !!!!
critical period for China's economic reform and opening-up, which is full of opportunities and challenges China's market !!!!
economy will develop rapidly on what has already been achieved into a bright future.
******Australia:
Australia is a relatively open, trade-exposed economy. This means that changes in other countries� demand for our !!!!
goods and services can have significant implications for our economy. For example, an increase in global demand for !!!!
Australia's exports, if not matched by an increase in supply, will result in an increase in the price of those !!!!
exports.
The ratio of export prices to import prices is called the terms of trade. This Explainer outlines the effects of the !!!!
2005�11 terms of trade boom on the Australian economy.
******Germany:
After the devastation of World War II, West Germany rebounded with a so-called �economic miracle� that!!!!
 began in 1948. The subsequent combination of growth and stability made West Germany�s economic system !!!!
 one of the most respected in the world, though it began to suffer strains beginning in the 1990s,!!!!
  exacerbated by the costs of unification. Germany�s remarkable economic performance was largely a result of effective !!!!
  economic management, but temporary factors were especially important in spurring economic growth in the immediate !!!!
  post-World War II era. In particular, a large force of unemployed workers�returned servicemen and displaced !!!!
  persons�were available and eager to rebuild their own lives and willing to work hard at a rate of remuneration that left !!!!
  a considerable investment surplus in their employers� hands. In addition, the country reaped benefits from the joint !!!!
  economic planning for the American, British, and French zones of occupation that culminated in the vital and essential!!!!
   currency reform that introduced the deutsche mark in June 1948 and the U.S.-financed Marshall Plan !!!!
   (1948�52), which helped to rebuild war-torn Europe.
From 1951 to 1961 West Germany�s gross national product (GNP) !!!!
rose by 8 percent per year�double the rate for Britain and the United States and nearly double that of France�and !!!!
exports trebled. 
******Japan:
Many people believe the United States was once the greatest economy in the world, but beginning in the 1970s!!!!
 the Japanese "caught" the Americans. Today, so the assumption goes, the Japanese are superior and America is on !!!!
 a downward economic spiral. Many Americans also believe that through such practices as permanent employment and !!!!
 the seniority system, Japanese business managers have caused worker productivity to surpass the U.S. First of all,!!!!
  Japan never "caught" the U. S. in an economic sense. From the early 1950s until the Arab oil shocks of the 1970s, !!!!
  Japan experienced one of the most impressive periods of economic growth in recorded history. Still, when Japanese !!!!
  output, per capita income, and productivity are compared to that of the U.S., the latter country is much stronger!!!!
   in most respects.
While together the U.S. and Japan are responsible for between 30% and 40% of world output, the !!!!
overall output of the Japanese economy is only approximately 42% that of the U.S. Japanese per capita income !!!!
is 83% that of the U.S. Greater U.S. output of goods and services per labor hour, or higher productivity is a !!!!
major reason our economy is stronger than that of Japan. The American worker continues in the 1990s to be the !!!!
most productive in the world, as has been true throughout this century.
******6.Korean:
The economy of South Korea is a highly developed mixed economy. By nominal GDP, it has the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 10th largest in the world. South Korea is notable for its emergence of economic development from an underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few generations. This economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which has allowed it to join OECD and the G-20. South Korea still remains one of the fastest growing developed countries in the world, following the Great Recession. It is included in the group of Next Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the global economy by the middle of the 21st century.
South Korea's education system and the establishment of a motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the country's high technology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an export-oriented economic strategy to fuel its economy. In 2019, South Korea was the eighth largest exporter and eighth largest importer in the world. The Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.
******7.Malaysla:
The dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar caused intense divisions within Malaysia, but Mahathir, benefiting from an economic recovery, was able to retain his grip on political power. In 2003 Mahathir stepped down as prime minister and was replaced by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (his handpicked successor), who won a landslide victory the following year. With Mahathir out of office, Anwar�s conviction was overturned in 2004, and he was released.
In March 2008 Anwar led a coalition of opposition parties�called the People�s Alliance (Pakatan Rakyat; PR)�that gained more than one-third of the seats in Malaysia�s lower house of parliament, even though he still could not run for office. Anwar officially returned to politics later that year, and in October he won a solid victory in a parliamentary by-election, even though, shortly before the election, he was again charged with sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, Abdullah faced growing criticism, largely for his failure to curtail corruption, and in October 2008 he announced his intention to resign the following March. Abdullah was succeeded in office by his deputy prime minister, Najib Razak (son of Abdul Razak), in April 2009.
******8.Singapore:
Singapore has achieved sustained, rapid growth, at an unprecedented pace. Before the Crisis 1997, it surpassed both Japan and Hong Kong in per capita real income, and reached within 10% of the American level, which is the world's highest. The strategy initiated under Dr. Goh Keng Swee has succeeded beyond expectations. The prospect is to enjoy a per capita income path somewhat higher than America (by a "city effect"), at the American pace. There remain the challenges of decelerated growth, intensifying competition and sectoral adjustments like Finland had in the 1990s. One needs built-in resilience through human capital investment and entrepreneurship.
******9.Thailand:
Thailand experienced rapid growth, at an annual rate of around 8%, before the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. It recovered quickly from that crisis but economic expansion has remained more modest ever since. Despite slower growth in recent decades, per capita incomes have continued increasing due to fast demographic transition. Thailand joined the group of upper middle-income countries in the early 2010s.
Economic development has led by rapid urbanisation, coupled with the emergence of industrial hubs. Thailand�s development model involved a long-term structural shift from agriculture to industry, enabled first by an import substitution policy and later by greater emphasis on export promotion and an investor-friendly industrial policy. Nonetheless, one-third of the population is still involved in agriculture and it remains important to ensure that an agrarian population, already the lowest income sector in the country, does not get left further behind. Their function remains important for the Thai economy, for example in respect of food security.
